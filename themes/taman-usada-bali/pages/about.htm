			Taman Usada Bali is a wellness destination that promotes the ancient practices of traditional Balinese healing therapies, Usada Bali, yoga, meditation, and herbology to global wellness. We intuitively integrate this unique practice of the local wisdom with the source of the science of life, Ayurveda. It is a truly holistic healing retreat to nourish the ultimate wellness of your being with the experts. We guide you to live a healthy lifestyle through body constitution enhancement.
			<br><br>
			Balinese people live equally in two worlds, the seen, Skala, and the unseen, Niskala. In the traditional Balinese healing process, we address both elements. The world of Niskala uniquely involves a spiritual aspect to healing a patient through rituals, offering presentation, purification, chanting mantra, and holy water. All this healing ritual invites you to immerse in the experiential mysticism of traditional Balinese healing therapies.
